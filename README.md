# autoERP
LNS automated Matlab scripts for pre-processing raw EEG signal into filtered epoched data (Filtering_epoching.m), performing Independent Components Analyses (ICA) (Comp_ICA.m), and computing ERPs after interpolation and artefacts rejection (ERPs.m).

**⚠️ Currently only compatible with raw .bdf (BioSemi) and .set files with 64 channels**

## Description:
Flexible and adaptable to all designs and folder trees.

All steps can be skiped. All default values can be modified.

A log is generated after each run to explain what was done to the files.

*For more information on how to get started, please refer to the **User Manual**.*

**Script order and details:**


### 1) Filter_epoching.m
This script filters, imports marker files (.mrk) and epochs .bdf or .set files.
You can create and save your epoching parameters in a .mat file to re-load them in a future use of this script.

Filtering pipeling:
1. Re-referencing
2. Bandpass filtering
3. Removing sinusoidal noise (CleanLine)
4. Detecting blinks (Blinker)
5. Non-sinusoidal noise filtering (ASR)
6. Removing the blinks detected in 4.
7. Applying baseline correction

At the end of the epoching process, a to_interpolate.xlsx file is generated. \
You can write in it the bad channels that will have to be interpolated and load them during the ERPs script. \
**Do not erase the first example line of the to_interpolate.xlsx file.**


### 2) comp_ICA.m (optionnal)
This script will automatically computed ICA on all the loaded files and will prompt the user to select the components that should be rejected for each of the files. 
The components rejection graphical interface is based on the (ICLabel)[https://sccn.ucsd.edu/wiki/ICLabel] display. 


### 3) ERPs.m

1. Interpolate the bad channels
2. Reject epochs containings artifacts while ignoring the bad channels: 80uV threshold criterion and 30uV jumps
3. Compute the ERP based on averaging parameters 
4. Compute the average reference or reference to Cz

You can create and save your averaging parameters to re-load them in a future use of this script.
If no merging condition and no events are given, each file will be averaged over all its epochs.
At the end of the run, a file named Ntrials.xlsx is generated. It contains the number of epochs at the start, deleted during artifacts rejection, and in the final ERPs.
