1) Filter_epoching.m
   This script filters, implements .mrk and epochs .bdf or .set
   You can create and save your epoching parameters in a .mat file to re-load it in a future use of this script.

Order of actions:
1. Re-reference
2. Bandpass filtering
3. Remove sinusoidal noise (CleanLine)
4. Detect blinks
5. ASR filtering
6. Remove the detected blinks in 4.
7. Baseline correction


2) comp_ICA.m
   After having manually computed ICA, you can load the concerned .set to choose the components you want to remove.
   For each folder, you will have the topography of the component, the scroll of their activation and the full eeg data scroll to take your decision.
   ! This decision is asked only once per subfolder !
   -> After rejecting the components, you can epoch them wihout filtering them with the Filter_epoching.m script with your saved epoching parameters.


3) ERPs.m
   Reject artefact on a 80uV criterion while ignoring bad channels, create the ERP based on averaging parameters and then interpolate the bad channels.
   You decide which subjects and which bad channels need to be taken into account and can save this decision into a .mat file.
   You can create and save your averaging parameters to re-load it in a future use of this script.
   If no merging condition and no events are given, each file will be averaged on all its epochs.
